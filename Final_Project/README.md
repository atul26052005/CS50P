Description:
The Expense Tracker is a simple yet highly effective tool designed to help users record, manage, and track their expenses effortlessly. Whether you're budgeting for a shopping trip, keeping track of daily expenditures, or planning for a big purchase, this application ensures that all your financial details are organized, easily accessible, and automatically calculated.

Why Use This Expense Tracker?
In everyday life, managing expenses can often become overwhelming and time-consuming. People usually rely on mental calculations, handwritten notes, or scattered phone memos to track their spending. However, these methods are inefficient and prone to errors. Manually summing up costs not only increases the chances of mistakes but also wastes valuable time—especially when dealing with a long list of expenses.

This Expense Tracker eliminates these hassles by providing a structured, automated approach to tracking expenses. Instead of performing calculations manually, users can simply enter each expense along with its description, and the program will handle the rest. By using a simple menu-driven system, users can quickly:

Record new expenses
View all recorded transactions
Get an instant total of their spending
Save data for future reference
The interface is intuitive and beginner-friendly, allowing users to interact with the program using just a few keystrokes (1, 2, 3, or 4). No complex commands or technical knowledge are required.

How This Helps You Save Time
Imagine walking into a store with a list of items to buy. Instead of constantly rechecking your mental math or flipping through paper notes, you can use this program to instantly view and update your expenses. With a simple command, you’ll see the total amount spent so far, helping you stay within your budget.

Additionally, since the program automatically stores all expenses in a text file (expenses.txt), users don’t have to worry about losing their data. Even after closing the program, all recorded expenses remain safely stored and can be retrieved later. If an item needs to be removed, users can simply edit the text file.

This feature makes the application especially useful for:

Students tracking their monthly allowances
Shoppers managing a grocery list and budget
Anyone looking to monitor their daily, weekly, or monthly spending
By simplifying expense tracking, this project saves time, reduces stress, and enhances financial awareness.
